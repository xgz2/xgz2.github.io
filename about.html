      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <img src="headshot.jpg" alt="Picture of me!" width="150" height="200">
      <p>Hi, my name is George Zhuang, and I am a senior studying Computer Science at <a class="cornell" href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu">Cornell University</a>.</p>
      <p>This summer, you can find me working as a Software Engineering Intern on XR Graphics at <a class="meta" href="https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/">Meta</a> in Menlo Park. After, I will be at <a class="scale" href="https://scale.com">Scale AI</a> for 3 months in San Francisco. In the past, I worked at <a class="mongo" href="https://www.mongodb.com">MongoDB</a> on the Cloud Insights and Telemetry Team as a Software Engineering Intern in New York City.</p>
      <p>As a student, I chose a path that delved deep into theoretical and practical Computer Science education while also expanding my business accumen and leadership skills. As a member of the Global China Connection business club, I developed a deeper understanding of finance and entrepreneurship through multiple case studies. As a Recruitment Chair and VP of Recruitment, I spent 4 semesters leading the organizations recruitement efforts, focusing on selecting high quality candidates and illuminating diversity and inclusion shadows. During the Spring Semester of my Freshman year, I met a community of engineers I have great love for through the Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity. Throughout my time in the fraternity, I have had roles ranging from planning fun events to helping members learn professional skills.</p>
      <p>If you would be interested in speaking more about my experiences, please feel free to email me at xgz2 [at] cornell [dot] edu or view my resume.</p>
